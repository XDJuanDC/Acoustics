# Acoustic Modeling

Jupyter notebooks to compute the acoustic absorption of a porous absorber panel.

The porous absorber is considered an equivalent fluid with properties given by the JCAL model. In the 1D model, using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), the porous absorber is considered both rigid [[TMM-JCAL]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XDJuanDC/Acoustics/blob/main/TMM_JCAL.ipynb) and elastic through the Biot model [[TMM-Biot-JCAL]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XDJuanDC/Acoustics/blob/main/TMM_Biot_JCAL.ipynb).
A 3D model, developed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with the JCAL model, is also shown [[FEM-JCAL]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XDJuanDC/Acoustics/blob/main/FEM_JCAL.ipynb).

It can be opened and run using Google Colab or downloaded and run locally.
