# Acoustic Modeling

Jupyter notebooks to compute the acoustic absorption of a porous absorber panel.

The porous absorber is considered an equivalent fluid with properties given by the JCAL model. In the 1D model, using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), the porous absorber is considered both rigid [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XDJuanDC/Acoustics/blob/main/TMM_JCAL.ipynb) and elastic through the Biot model [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XDJuanDC/Acoustics/blob/main/TMM_Biot_JCAL.ipynb).
A 3D model, developed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with the JCAL model, is also shown [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XDJuanDC/Acoustics/blob/main/FEM_JCAL.ipynb).

It can be opened and run using Google Colab. [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XDJuanDC/Acoustics/blob/main/TMM_JCAL.ipynb)
